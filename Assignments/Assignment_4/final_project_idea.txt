The idea for my project is to analyze the data for the TV show Survivor. I found a R library called survivoR from https://github.com/doehm/survivoR. I'm thinking about analyzing voting patterns, analyze alliances in the show, or a predictive model to determine future winners. 
The survivoR package contains several data sets for different aspects of the show such as player demographics, voting history, idols found, challenges won, and much more.
